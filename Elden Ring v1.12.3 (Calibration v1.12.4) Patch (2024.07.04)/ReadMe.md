>>>HDiff Patch: Elden Ring v1.12.3 (Calibrations v1.12.4) (Build 14903191) (2024.07.04)<<<

[Requirements]
-Elden Ring v1.12 (Calibrations v1.12.2) (Build 14827766) (2024.06.26)
-Patch requires at least 30GB of free hard drive space.

[Directions for Patching]
-Run the patch executable.
-Browse directories and select the game folder.
-If the version is correct, patcher will allow patching.

[When Patching]
-Leave [ExternalData] and [PatchData] as-is in folder.
-PLEASE keep Save Backup + Verify Hash enabled.
-Disabling Save Backup will not affect the required space.
-Save Backup tells patcher to not remove Backup folder after patching.
-Amount of time to finish patch varies depending on user hardware and game files.

[After Patching]
-Can decide to delete or keep Backup folder to revert back to previous version.

[CheckSums Folder]
- SFV stands for Simple File Verification. Stores CRC32 Checksums.
- Each SFV file has the checksum values for that specific game version.
- The Checksum values are for game files that are 100% clean. Not cracked.
- RapidCRC.exe is a portable application that compares SFV with game files.

:::How to use:::
1. Place RapidCRC.exe into game folder.
2. Place SFV file into game folder that matches the version.
3. Drog and Drop SFV onto RapidCRC.exe to begin verification.
4. Will only 100% match with Clean Steam Files. Not cracked.
5. It's okay if there are mismatches because:
	- The steam_api.dll / steam_api64.dll are the Steam Emulator.
	- The executable is the cracked or SteamStub unpacked exe.
	- Other modified files meant to crack the game.
		
[Steam Manifests Folder]
-All Steam games have an AppManifest and Depot Manifest(s).
-AppManifest provides information about the installed Steam game.
-Depot Manifests provides information about the game files.
-They are for archival purposes and for Greenluma users.
-They are not important for patching.
